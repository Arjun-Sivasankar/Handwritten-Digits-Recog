# **Handwritten Digit Recognizer with GUI**

This project is a Handwritten Digit Recognizer with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Python. It allows users to draw a digit on the screen and the application will attempt to recognize the digit using a pre-trained machine learning model.

## **Features**

- User-friendly GUI for drawing digits.
- Real-time recognition of handwritten digits.
- Machine learning model for accurate recognition.
- Clear button to erase the drawing canvas.
- Save button to save the recognized digit as an image file.

## **Requirements**

To run the Handwritten Digit Recognizer with GUI, ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter library
- NumPy library
- Matplotlib library
- scikit-learn library

## **Acknowledgements**

The Handwritten Digit Recognizer with GUI project was inspired by various tutorials and examples available online. The machine learning model used in this project is based on the MNIST dataset, which is a widely used dataset for handwritten digit recognition tasks.
